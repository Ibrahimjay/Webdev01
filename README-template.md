### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css

.colourNumbers li::before{
    content: counter(count-me) '.';
    display: block;
    position: relative;
    max-width: 0px;
    max-height: 0px;
    left: -1.3em;
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    font-weight: bold;
    
}
```
```css
li::marker{
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```
```css
tbody>tr>:nth-child(2){
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development


- I would like to learn how to make use of the fonts provided ie to be able to download or import ... fonts and use them

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with the css. 
- [Example resource 2](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
